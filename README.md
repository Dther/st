# Dther's Simple Terminal Fork
A personal fork of the suckless st (simple terminal). 

The main important part of this repository is config.h, but
future patches may be added for functionality's sake.

## Current Planned Patches
   * iso14755
   * Some kind of prompt to prevent accidental quitting by X
    
## Patches that were added at one point, but later removed
   * alpha
        * Could be accomplished by modifying compton.conf.
   * scrollback
        * Could be accomplished with tmux, with the added benefit of
            everything tmux provides.
   * Xresources
        * Consistent colours are good for syntax highlighting, wal
            colour schemes have unfortunately poor contrast.

necessary as root):
